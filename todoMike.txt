Ben,
running cabal update improved things - the files compile now - generating .o files

mikeh@mikeh-Latitude-D830 ~/Hls $ cabal install parsec
cabal: failed to parse output of 'ghc-pkg dump'

but the link stage fails with:
ghc --make "Hwhoami.hs" (in directory: /home/mikeh/Hls)
Linking Hwhoami ...
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ltinfo
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
`gcc' failed in phase `Linker'. (Exit code: 1)
Compilation failed.


I use geany 1.29, which lets me lint (hlint) easily. I use ghc 8.0.2 . 

-> I had not taken too much notice of cabal as I seemed to get my small stuff working without too much reference to cabal - I know that I still have some learning issues with the system hierachy 

cabal / stack / ghci / etc 

Sending this via meetup - as not wanting to taint any github comms at the moment...
good fun, low priority I suppose...
Mike
