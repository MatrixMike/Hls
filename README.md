## Haskell clone of ls ##

Hls is intended to be a haskell implementation of the unix ls command.

Still needs (lots of) work:
 - Work on real IO.
 - Lifting pure functions into IO *properly*.
 - Recursive.
 - Colors.
 - Full ls interoperativity.
 - The world.

Depends on:
System.Console.Terminfo.Cursor
